1) Join two dataframes in all possible ways.

2) Scan a column to determine if this is true and if it is really just Y or N, then change the column type to boolean and have false/true as the values of the cells. Use scala code only.

3) Implement an example of spark dataframe explode function using Java code. Code only enough, results are not required.

4) Below there is small DataFrame. You should use DataFrame API functions and UDFs to accomplish two tasks.
a) You need to parse the State and City into two different columns.
b) You need to get the number of days in between the start and end dates. Perform it in two ways.
	i) Firstly, you should use SparkSQL functions to get this date difference.
	ii)Secondly, you should write a UDF that gets the number of days between the end date and the start date.

id|end_date|start_dae|location
1|2015-10-14 00:00:00|2015-09-14 00:00:00|CA-SF
2|2015-10-15 01:00:20|2015-08-14 00:00:00|CA-SD
3|2015-10-16 02:30:00|2015-01-14 00:00:00|NY-NY
4|2015-10-17 03:00:20|2015-02-14 00:00:00|NY-NY
5|2015-10-18 04:30:00|2014-04-14 00:00:00|CA-SD


5) Create sample xml with namespace and generate dataframe

6) Write an equivalent Java/Scala/Python code for this query-
	select count(*) from diamonds where clarity = "SI2"
