1) Assume a table have storeID and SalesAmount Column. and data is coming each Day. Design Efficient Table Structure in Hive.

Solve problems 2 to 6 using both hive and spark-

2) A table have rollNumber, Subject and Marks. Each Student appeared for 6 Subjects. Find Max 4 marks and subject for Each Student. If a student have same marks in all subject then also only 4 subject should come in result.

3) A table have rollNumber and totalMarks. find 5th highest marks.

4) A dataframe have 4 column c1, c2, c3 and c4.
replace the data as below:
Column : ifValue : toValue
C1 		: X		 : i 
C2		: Y		 : j
C3      : Z		 : k

5) Implement above without when function.

6) A Table have flghtID, CustomerID, flightDate. get most popular day when customer prefer to fly. Complete this without using predefined function.

7) Use of partitioning in hive tables 

8) If we drop partition from physical path, what would be the impact on table. 

9) Scenario based question on data 
	ID 		Code 
	
	1 		400 
	
	2 		500 
	
	3 		700 
	
	4 		500 
	
	1 		800 
	
	2 		500 

a) Provide code from table which came only one time in the table 

b) Provide id which are having unique code 

c) Do it in hive query and then in spark
